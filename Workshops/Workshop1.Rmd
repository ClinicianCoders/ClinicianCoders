## What is R?

- Open-source software for data analysis and visualisation
- Compatible with a variety of platforms
    - UNIX
    - MacOS
    - Windows
- Particularly well suited to data science/statistics

## Why use R?

- Why not?
    - Need to learn a new language.
    - Does not use 'point and click'.
    - Need to describe to the computer the steps you want it to take.
- Why?
    - Anything you can do in spreadsheets, you can do in R plus **so much more**.
    - Not limited to the pre-designed command process of an app.
    - You record everything you do, so you can do it again.

## Really, why R?

- Save time
    - Small upfront investment for long term gain
    - New data + same analysis? - Easy 
    - Found an error? - Easy
- Reproducible Science
    - Code makes your analysis explicit
    - Writing code = writing lab-book = good reproducible science

## Typical data science pipeline

::: notes
Taken from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html

- **Import**: need to import data into R
- **Tidy**: in short, this is the process of arranging data such that each variable is a column and each observation is a row. Done to ensure compatibility with functions.
- **Transform**: can be narrowing in on observations of interest (e.g. only female patients); creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (e.g. time of stay = discharge date - arrival date); calculating summary statistics (e.g. counts or means).
- Process of **tidying** + **transforming** = **wrangling**
- **Visualisation**: once data has been transformed, it should be visualised. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data.
- **Modelling**: once your question is sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer the question.
- **Communication**: critical part of any data analysis project is communicating the results to others.

## Working with RStudio 

- RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- Easier to work with than R on it's own, since it it a bit more 'point and clicky'
- Allows
    - Code editing
    - Syntax highlighting (i.e. highlighting of different sub-elements of syntax such as comments, control-flow statements, variables, etc.)
    - Plotting tools
    - Workspace management 

## This is what R on it's own looks like

![](../Images/RConsole.png)

## This is what RStudio looks like - much easier to work with

![](../Images/RStudio.png)

::: notes
Ask learners to open RStudio, but don't get them to type anything in yet.
:::

## RStudio is made up of windows

![](../Images/RStudioHighlightWindows.png)

::: notes
Explain each window.

- Console - this is where R is run. Commands executed but not saved.
- Source - text files that contain commands.
- Environment - tells you which R objects you are working with.
- Files - actually a helper window. Gives you files, help, plots. Warn people not to delete files from their computer.
:::

## Adjusting your view of RStudio

![](../Images/RStudioButtonsHighlighted.png)

::: notes
Explain what each button does.
:::

## Using the Console window

![](../Images/RStudioConsole.png)

## Using the console

- Bottom left window.
- This is R!
- This is your prompt to type  `>`.
- Type `2 + 2` then hit `Enter`.

## Console output

- You should see:

```{r}
2 + 2
```

-  `>` is the command prompt
-  `2 + 2` is the command
-  `4` is the output from R.
-  `[1]` is telling you that 4 is the first value in a sequence returned by R.

::: notes
Say that the ## sign is just printed on the slide as an indicator that we are seeing output rather than code entered. They shouldn't see the symbol on their consoles.
:::

## Using the Source

![](../Images/RStudioSource.png)

## Using the Source

- Type `2 + 2`, then `Enter`.
- What happens?
- To ask R to run code
    - Highlight the code and:
        - MacOS: `Cmd + Enter`
        - Windows: `Ctrl + Enter`
- Notice the output in the console.

## Saving your work

- Click the `save` icon 
    - Save the file under a meaningful name. 
    - Save it somewhere you can find it again.
    - .R is the file extension for R scripts.
- Close the Source window.
- Close R Studio.
- Restart R Studio and click the `open` icon.
- Find your file and open.
- Your code should still be there.
- You can run it again.

?Use this to introduce the labbook idea?
Every scientist is expected to maintain a labbook and this should be no different for a data scientist; so each time you sit down to work create a new file; I do this by creating a directory in each project called labbooks and then files named according as `CCYY-MM-DD.R`

## R building blocks

- Object names
- Data
    - **Vectors**
    - **Data frames**
    - Matrices
    - Lists
- Functions
    - Stored in packages
    
::: notes

In this course, we will primarily be using vectors and data frames.

:::

## 3 main building blocks

1. Object names
    - Everything needs a name in R: tables, plots, data files, functions 
2. Data
    - Data comes in different classes: 
        - Real numbers - `numeric`
        - Discrete numbers - `integer`
        - Characters - `character`
    - Data can be stored in vectors
    - Vectors can be stored in data frames
3. Functions
    - Little factories
    - Take an input (raw material) use function (factory) get an output (product)
    - Functions are collated into packages

## Object names

- You assign names to objects in R.
- This is the assignment operator `<-`(`=`)
- Shortcut:
    - Mac OSX: `Option + - `
    - Windows: `Alt + - `
- Return the stored value by typing the name.

```{r}
practice <- 2 + 2 + 6
practice
```

::: notes
Get them to do this.
:::

## Object names

- You can store any object under a name.
- This example stores a character variable. You need to use quote marks to assign it.

```{r}
say_hello <- "hello"
say_hello
```

- Note that R does not like spaces in names.
```{r, error = TRUE}
say hello <- "hello"
```

## Data
- R is a statistical computing language
- It is built around an understanding of data
- Statistics uses:
    - Vectors
    - Data frames

## Vectors

- A vector contains elements of the same data type.
    - A vector of integers - an example would be age
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19, 48)
```
    - A vector of real numbers - an example would be temperature.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(37.5, 37.1, 37.3, 38.3, 37.4, 38.9)
```
    - A vector of characters/strings - an example would be name.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James")
```
    - A vector of logicals - an example would be 'are the blood results avaiblable?'
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
```
- You can always check the data type in a vector using the function `class()`.
```{r}
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
class(logical_vector)
```


## Naming vectors

- The `c()` function combines individual values into a single vector.
```{r}
# Storing several ages in one vector.
age <- c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19)
age
# Storing several peoples' names in one vector.
name <- c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer")
name
```

## Recalling elements of a vector

- R creates an index for each element of the vector.
- It allocates a number to each element within the vector from left to right, starting with `1`.

```{r}
# The age of the second person.
age[2]
# The age of the fourth person.
age[4]
# The name of the fifth person.
name[5]
```

## Exercise: Vectors - other properties

- Remember, vectors contain elements of the same data type.
- Thus, what would happen if we were to add a value of `TRUE` to a vector of integers?
- Use `class()` to examine the class of the vector. What has happened?

```{r}
# Add a value of TRUE to a vector of integers 
test <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, TRUE)

```

## Solution: Vectors - other properties
```{r}

# Recall the vector
test

# Examine the class of the vector
class(test)

```

- The value of `TRUE` has been changed to 1.
- The vector is still a numeric vector.
- This is because logical vectors (i.e. `TRUE`/`FALSE`) can be coded in a binary format (1/0).

## Exercise: Vectors - other properties
- Add a character variable to a vector of integers.

```{r}
test2 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, "hi")
```

- Recall the vector and use `class()` to examine the class of the vector. What has happened?

## Solution: Vectors - other properties

```{r}
# Recall the vector
test2

# Examine the class of the vector
class(test2)

```

- The character variable has been added on to the end of the vector.
- The vector is now a character vector.

## Data frames
- You are already familiar with data frames

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gender <- c("male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female")
data.frame(name, age, gender)
```

- A data frame is a series of vectors aligned to form a table
- Each vector becomes a column in the table
- A properly formatted excel spreadsheet is essentially a data frame

## Exercise: Creating a data frame 

- Create and name vectors containing information about these 6 patients.
    - `Name: "Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer"`
    - `Age: 50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19`
    - `Gender: "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female"`
- Quotation marks are not needed for object names in R, but are when your data is made up of characters e.g. "male", "female".
- As a rule:
    - Characters on the left side of the assignment operator. No quote marks.
    - Characters on the right side of the assignment operator. Use quote marks if storing letters.

## Exercise: Creating a data frame
- Combine these vectors into a data frame using `data.frame()`.
    - Hint, the vector names need to go inside the `()`.
- Save the data frame under the name `patients`.
- Print the data frame called `patients` to your console.

## Solution: Creating a data frame

```{r}
# Creating individual vectors.

name <- c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer")
age <- c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19)
gender <- c("male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female")


# Combining into a data frame.

patients <- data.frame(name, age, gender)
```

## Solution: Creating a data frame
```{r}
patients
```

- R arranges the vectors as columns in the data frame.
- R names the columns of the data frame after the names of the vectors.
- R numbers each row of the data frame, creating an index for each row within the data frame.

## Recalling a vector in a data frame
- Data frame columns are vectors.
- `$` can be used to extract a vector from a data frame.
- We can get the `age` column from the data frame `patients`.
```{r}
patients$age
```

## Functions as factories

## Functions as factories
![](../Images/Function2.png)

## Functions as factories
![](../Images/Function3.png)


## Functions
- Sometimes taught as a "black box".
- You can think of them as a factory.
- Usually labelled as a verb (they are "doing" something).
- Many come built into R.
    - `Sys.time()`
    - `mean(1:100)`
- You can also install 'packages' containing bundles of functions.

- View each function as a separate factory in a production line.

## Functions in a line
![](../Images/Function4.png)

## Functions
- You have been using functions already!
- `data.frame()` is a function.
- `age, gender, weight` are the input arguments.

```{r}
data.frame(name, age, gender)
```

- The data frame is the output.

## Try these functions yourself. What do they do?
- Use the `patients` data frame as the argument.

- `head()`
- `tail()`
- `summary()`

## Try these functions yourself.
- `head()` Gives you the first 6 rows
- `tail()` Gives you the last 6 rows
- `summary()` Gives an overview of the object
```{r}
summary(patients)
```


## Warning note
- Functions are carrying out pre-written instructions.
- They will fail if they are supplied with the wrong kind of data - they will return an error message instead.
- Try `mean(patients$gender)`
- There are other constraints, which are dependent on the function itself.
- HINT: some functions will not work with missing values. You will then need to specify the argument to remove these missing values.

## Help with functions
- How do you find out how to use a particular function?
- Three ways:
    - Select the `help` tab in bottom right of RStudio, then type the function name into the search box, and read the help page.
    - Type `?function_name` into the console.
    - If you can’t remember the exact function name try typing `??whatever_you_want_to_do` into the console. It searches the whole database for matching terms.

::: notes
Get them to look up the help page for mean
:::

## This is what a help page looks like.
![](../Images/HelpPage.png)

## Reading the help page

- It's quite complicated.
- But the information is usually displayed in a standard format:
    - Brief description
    - An example of use
    - The argument(s) that can be passed to the function - along with any default value it takes if there is no value provided.
    - Breakdown of these arguments. Gives you more information about what you need to put in.
    - Tells you how the function works and what to expect to see in the output. 
    - A reproducible example of use, that you can normally use verbatim.

::: notes
reference this back to the factory idea
argument = names of the inputs
function = machine/factory
value = output
:::
    
## Explore functions yourself

- Look up the function `ls`
- What are the arguments you can give the function?

    - How do you specify the argument for 'pattern'? Try it.
    - When might this be useful?

    - How do you specify the argument for 'sorted'? Try it.
    - When might this be useful?

::: notes
Work through this with them.
:::

## Packages - collections of functions

- There are bunch of functions that come with R. They are 'base R' functions.

- Thousands of open access functions in other packages.
- To access these: install the packages, then load them.

- Let's install and load the 'tidyverse' package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

- You can now use all of the functions that come with 'tidyverse'.
- You need to load the package using `library` each time you open R. But you will not need to install it again.

::: notes
Get them to load tidyverse. Emphasise that this is a process we will keep repeating throughout the course. 
:::

## Other useful packages

- These are some packages we will be user later in the course.

    - `ggplot2` - plots graphs in R
    - `readr` - imports data into R
    - `stringr` - helps you manipulate strings
    - `lubridate` - helps you manipulate dates

::: notes
Maybe mention that a few of these packages are loaded with tidyverse.
