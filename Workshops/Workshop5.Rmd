## Visualising data in R

![This book is helpful](../Images/R4DS.png)

::: notes
We now get to draw graphs!
:::

## There are many ways to plot graphs in R

- Base R has visualisation commands

- `ggplot2` package which allows you to 'layer' features of graphs
    - this is what we will use
    - load it now
    - `library(ggplot2)`

## Structure of a ggplot command

It takes a while to get used to the structure.

There are different forms of syntax.

Different syntax possible

But in general:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = date_frame_name) +
  style_of_plot(mapping = aes(x = vector_name1, y = vector_name2))
```

::: notes 
This will become more clear once we see examples
:::

## ggplot is very versatile

You can use the same structure for many types of graphs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = date_frame_name) +
  style_of_plot(mapping = aes(x = vector_name1, y = vector_name2)) +
  other_arguments
```

::: notes
Explain a couple of things you can add on using the + sign.
:::

## What is a 'geom'?

A `geom` is a visual aspect of a graph.

- dots
- lines
- bars

Look at the `ggplot2` cheatsheet for more options.

## Create a dot plot

Open up the R script called `Workshop5.R`.
Run through the commands in it.
Notice how changing small parts of the main command change the appearance of the graph. 

Notice that we use `geom_point` for a dot plot. We will use other geoms later.

::: notes
There are a lot of commands in the file. Help them load up the file, get the dataset into their environment, and run the commands. Give them a little time to look at the different graphs.
:::

## Let's create a line graph together

::: notes
Get them to type this code in and draw the graph. The graph they should get is on the next slide.
:::

```{r, eval = T, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = wbc, y = crp))
```

## Adding a linetype

```{r, eval = T, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = wbc, y = crp, linetype = sex))
```

## Adding colour 

```{r, eval = T, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = wbc, y = crp, colour = sex))
```


## Combining multiple geoms

```{r, , message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = wbc, y = crp, colour = sex)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = wbc, y = crp))
```

## Bar Graph

![](../Images/GraphTypes.png)

## Drawing a bar graph

- `geom_bar` and `stat_count` are interchangeable

```{r, eval = T, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = medical))


ggplot(data = cchic) +
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = medical))
```

## Proportion instead of count

```{r, eval = T, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = medical, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

## Adding a second aesthetic

```{r, eval = T, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = medical, fill = sex))
```

## Standardising proportions

```{r, eval = T, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = medical, fill = sex), position = "fill")
```

## Changing position of bars

```{r, eval = T, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = medical, fill = sex), position = "fill")
```
