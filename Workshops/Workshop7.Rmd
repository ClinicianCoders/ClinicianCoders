## Outline

- **Concept** + practice = expert
- Conditional statements 
- Looping fundamentals
- 

::: notes
Try to teach a concepts then they can go home and practice. 
:::

## You will learn

- When might I want to restrict using a conditional statement? 
- How do I write an if else statement? 
- What is the basic structure of a loop? 
- Why are loops important? 

## Before we start

- Again, please make sure the `cchic` dataframe is loaded into your R environment
- Please download Workshop7.R via https://github.com/ClinicianCoders/ClinicianCoders/Workshops/Workshop7.R
- Question: How do we calculate the mean of every numeric variable in `chicc` and print it out? 

## Control flow inituition 

- In the case of a particular event, do action x
- Permits flexibility 
- No one size fits all algorithms

::: notes
If I gave you one instruction, the entire time, this would greatly limit the complexity of what I can tell someone to do. If it rains, take an umbrella. If it you have gone to visited Wuhan, quarantine yourself
:::

## Control flow syntax

- Control flow is an `if` statement in R
- There are 3 parts to an `if` statement: 
    1. Test - Does it meet criteria? 
    2. Action - If yes, what should the algorithm do? 
    3. Else - And if not? 

## Example 1
    
```{r}

raining <- TRUE

if(raining == TRUE){
  
  print("Bring an umbrella!")
  
}

```

## Types of conditional tests

- Different syntax for different test: 
    - `x == y` - is x equal to y 
    - `x != y` - is x NOT equal to y
    - `x < y` - is x less than y
    - `x <= y` - is x less than or equal to y
    - `x > y` - is x greater than y
    - `x >= y` - is x greater than or equal to y
    
## Example 2 

```{r}

temp <- 32

if(temp >= 25){
  
  print("Put on sunscreen")
  
}

```

## Else...

- Sometimes we want to add a clause to tell the computer what to do if the condition is NOT met

## Example 3

```{r}

username <- "the1andonly"

if(username == "the1andonly"){
  
  print("Welcome!")
  
}else{
  
  print(paste("Intruder alert! Move away from the machine", username))
  
}

```

## Practice 1

- Try modifying example 3 to your own name, then rerunning - what does it print now? 
- Try filling in the practice to compute the correct summary statistic (`mean` or `median`) on the variable `cchic$urea`. Use `print` to print our your result. Remeber to remove NA's if needed. 

## Answer 1

```{r}

username <- "David"

if(username == "the1andonly"){
  
  print("Welcome!")
  
}else{
  
  print(paste("Intruder alert! Move away from the machine", username))
  
}

```

## Answer 2

```{r}

ggplot(data = cchic) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = urea), bins = 30)

normal <- FALSE

if(normal == TRUE){
  
  print(mean(cchic$urea, na.rm = T))
  
}else{
  
  print(median(cchic$urea, na.rm = T))
  
}

```

## Multiple conditional statements

- There are times when one condition is not enough 
- Here, we can string together multiple (as many as you like)  `else if` statements

## Example 4

```{r}

mean_urea <- mean(cchic$urea, na.rm = T)
median_urea <- median(cchic$urea, na.rm = T)

if(median_urea < mean_urea){
  
  print("Data is negatively skewed")
  
}else if(median_urea > mean_urea){

  print("Data is positively skewed")
  
}else{
  
  print("Data is normally distributed")
  
}

```

## Why loop?

- Copy pasting code is bad
- Rule of thumb if you copy-paste > 2 time, loop instead
- Huge/mutiple data sets
- Less human error-prone
- Perform same function many times

## Loop syntax

- **For** and while loops 
- Loops have 2 parts: 
    1. Number of iterations
    2. Body - what to do each iteration?
    
## Example 5

```{r}

for(i in 1:5){
  
  print(i)
  
}

```

## Example 6 - manual

```{r}

x <- c("the", "classic", "hello", "world", "example")
print(x[1])
print(x[2])
print(x[3])
print(x[4])
print(x[5])

```

## Example 6 - loop

```{r}

x <- c("the", "classic", "hello", "world", "example")

for(i in 1:5){
  
  print(x[i])
  
}

```

## Practice 2

- Write a loop that iterates across every column of `cchic` and prints out the column name of each column. 
- Hint: `length(cchic)` will return the number of columns.
- Hint: `print(names(cchic[1]))` will print out the contents of column 1. 

## Answer 

```{r, eval = F}

for(i in 1:length(cchic)){
  
  print(names(cchic[i]))
  
}

```

## Combining loops with control flow

- The power of looping is illustrated when you add in the flexibility of conditional statements

## Example 7

```{r}

for(i in 1:5){
  
  if(i == 1){
    
    print("one")
    
  }else{
    
    print(i)
    
  }
}

```

## Example 8

```{r}
for(i in 1:5){
  
  # the %% here checks the remainder when i is divided by 2
  if(i %% 2 == 0){
    
    print("even")
    
  }else{
    
    print("odd")
    
  }
}

```

## Practice 3

- Question: How do we calculate the mean of every numeric variable in `chicc` and print it out? 
- How would we do this manually?
- Hint: to check whether something is a numeric variable use `is.numeric()`

## Answer - manual 

```{r}

print(mean(cchic$lactate_abg))
print(mean(cchic$ph_abg))
print(mean(cchic$hco3_abg))
print(mean(cchic$temp_c))
print(mean(cchic$temp_nc))
# etc

```

## Answer - loop

```{r, eval = F}

for(i in 1:length(cchic)){
  
  print(names(cchic[i]))
  
  if(is.numeric(cchic[[i]])){
    
    print(mean(cchic[[i]]))
    
  }
  
}

```

## Go loopy!

- Lots of practice, lot's of errors! 
- But eventually, you'll never look back
