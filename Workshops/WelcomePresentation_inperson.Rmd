## The data

- We use the Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative dataset
    - Multicentre adult intensive therapy unit database
    - 11 adult intensive care units
    - 5 UK teaching hospitals
    - Privacy ensured through “highest standards of data security”
    - 18, 074 unique patients
    
- You will be using a synthetically derived dataset structured in a simillar format to the CCHIC data. 
- Data looks real, but isn't.

## Workshop layout

- 7 workshops
    - These include presentations and chances for you to follow along on your laptops.
    - Workshop 2: You work your way through a worksheet during . 
    - Workshop 7: You try to answer a question of your own using data. We will ask you to submit this question by the end of Day 2.
- A pdf file is available on the GitHub:   https://github.com/ClinicianCoders/ClinicianCoders/blob/master/Handout.pdf. It contains all of the content from the course workshops for future reference.  

## Final note - tips on writing code

- Save your work frequently!
- It takes a while to get the hang of writing code. 
- Be mindful as you type code out. 
    - Check your punctuation (e.g. placement of `()` or `,`). 
    - Capitalisation matters (e.g. `Data` vs `data`).
- Google is your friend.
- Tell us if you spot any errors we’ve made!

# **Thank you. We hope you enjoy the course.**
