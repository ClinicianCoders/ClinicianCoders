## The Data

    - 5 UK teaching hospitals
    - Privacy ensured through “highest standards of data security”
    - 18, 074 unique patients
    - Each with median 1030 time varying measurements (rows)
- You will be using a small annonymised extract from this dataset for the first part of the course.


## Workshop layout

- 7 workshops.
- 5 of these include a presentation and chances for you to follow along on your laptops.
- You work your way through a worksheet during Workshop 2. 
- You try to answer a question of your own using data during Workshop 7. 

- A pdf file will be uploaded to the Slack channel after this presentation. It contains all of the content from the course workshops for future reference. 

## Final note - tips on writing code

- Save your work where prompted by facilitator
- It takes a while to get the hang of writing code. 
- There may be code glitches (erroneous `()` or `,`) 
- But that is part of coding.
- Be mindful as you type them out
- Tell us if you spot any we’ve made!

# Thank you. We hope you enjoy the course.
