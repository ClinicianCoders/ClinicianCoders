# Pre-requisites for Clinician Coders.

Clinician Coders teaching is hands-on, so participants need to bring their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. In exchange, you will leave with a working version of R, and the skills to use it.

This course assumes no prior knowledge of the tools, but working through the course requires working copies of the software described below. We recommend you install the programmes below before the course begins. 

Please note all of the requirements specified below are free. Get in contact if you are about to hand over any money when setting up the pre-requisites, because you shouldn't be.

## Pre-course Objectives

- Install R

- Install R studio

- Download and install a speadsheet programme

- Join Slack

- Decide on the dataset you want to use for practice.

## Steps

### 1. Charge your laptop

We’ll provide a power bar, but it will be easier if you begin with a fully charged laptop. Don't forget to bring your laptop and power cord with you, as the course requires you to use your laptop continuously during the 2 days. 

### 2. Install R and R studio

We’re going to get you up and running in R which is a highly respected, free statistics package used by academics around the world. We will also install a friendly interface to R called RStudio.

Download and install R from [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

Download and install RStudio. This is a nice shiny interface for R, and the easiest way to use it. Download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). There should be an ‘installer’ for your operating system.

Operating system specific instructions and links are detailed below

**Windows**

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) file from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

**Mac OS X**

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) file from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

**Linux**

You can download the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

### 3. Download and install a spreadsheet program

This only applies if you don't already have Excel or simillar installed.

Spreadsheets are useful for data entry and data organization, and some subsetting and sorting of the data as well as getting an overview of the data. To interact with spreadsheets, we can use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel), [Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org/), [OpenOffice.org](https://www.openoffice.org/), or other programs. Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you can use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). It's a free, open source spreadsheet program.

### 4. Join our group on Slack
Slack is a geeky version of WhatsApp, but much better for coding and collaborating. We will use it to share files. You can use it chat, to ask questions, share material, and provide feedback. You should recieve an email invite to our group before the course.

### 5. Decide on the dataset you want to use for practice.
Workshop 7 of this course allows you to practice on your own data. You can either come in with your own dataset, and let us help you get started, or you can use the public version of the CCHIC dataset after signing the data sharing agreement. 

The rest of the course relies on a small anonymised dataset in a simillar format to the CCHIC one. All candidates will have access to this.


If you have problems with installing software, there is a small amount of setup time allocated for this at the beginning of the course. Bring your laptop, and we will be happy to help.

See you there!
