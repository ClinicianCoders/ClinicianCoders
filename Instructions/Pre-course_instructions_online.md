# Pre-requisites for Clinician Coders

Clinician Coders teaching is hands-on, so participants need to have access to laptops and ensure they have a proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. In exchange, you will leave with a working version of R, and the skills to use it.

This course assumes no prior knowledge of the tools, but working through the course requires working copies of the software described below. We ask that you install the programs below before the course begins. 

**Please note all of the programs specified below are free.** Get in contact if you are about to hand over any money when setting up the pre-requisites, because you shouldn't be.

## Pre-course Objectives

- Install R

- Install RStudio

- Download and install a speadsheet program

- Decide on the dataset you want to use for practice.

## Steps

### 1. Install R and RStudio

We’re going to get you up and running in R which is a highly respected, free statistics package used by academics around the world. We will also install a friendly interface to R called RStudio.

- Download and install R from [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
- Download and install RStudio. This is a nice shiny interface for R, and the easiest way to use it. Download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). There should be an ‘installer’ for your operating system.

Operating system specific instructions and links are detailed below.

**Windows**

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) file from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

**Mac OS X**

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) file from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

**Linux**

You can download the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

### 2. Download and install a spreadsheet program

> This only applies if you don't already have Excel or similar installed.

- Spreadsheets are useful for data entry and data organization, and some subsetting and sorting of the data as well as getting an overview of the data. 
- To interact with spreadsheets, we can use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel), [Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org/), [OpenOffice.org](https://www.openoffice.org/), or other programs. 
- Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.
- For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you can use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). It's a free, open source spreadsheet program.

### 3. Decide on the dataset you want to use for practice
- The course is run on a synthetic version of the CCHIC database, which is a Critical Care Collaboration across trusts. This is not real patient data, but is made to look real! You will all have access to this dataset. 
- Workshop 7 of this course allows you to put some of what you have learnt into practice. You can either come in with your own dataset, and let us help you get started, or you can continue using the synthetic CCHIC dataset.

If you have problems with installing software, we have allocated 5-10 minutes of setup time at the beginning of the course. 

# Clinician coders online

Given the online format, we thought it best to outline a few rules and expectations to ensure the course runs as smoothly as possible.

## Joining the event
- We will be delivering Clinician Coders using MS Teams. You can join a Teams meeting anytime, from any device, whether or not you have a Teams account.
- We recommend joining the meeting using the laptop you installed RStudio on.
- We ask that all participants join the meeting with:
  - **Their microphones on mute.**
  - **Their camera turned on.** There will not be that many participants, and we would like to foster a "classroom feeling".

## Screen sharing
- We ask that all participants are willing to share their screens should troubleshooting be necessary. 
- For those of you who are unfamiliar with MS Teams and screen sharing, please read this [guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-your-screen-during-a-meeting-90c84e5a-b6fe-4ed4-9687-5923d230d3a7).

## Question format
Due to the online format of the course, we have decided to classify questions into three categories that will be dealt with differently. Categories include:

- **General questions related to current workshop.** If you have a general question/issue related to the slides/material, we ask that you *raise a virtual hand* and the lead facilitator will pause the presentation to answer.  
- **Participant-specific questions/issues that are hindering ability to follow workshop.** If you have a question/issue that is hindering your ability to follow along with the workshop (e.g. coding error returned in RStudio), we ask that you *navigate to a break-out room* where a free assistant facilitator will help you.
- **Participant-specific questions/issues that do not require immediate assistance.** If you have a question that does not require immediate assistance (e.g. queries about exploring other packages that you may be interested in), we ask that you *post these in the Teams chat*. Facilitators will answer these in the breaks or during the workshop if they have time. 

This is the first time we will be delivering Clinician Coders in an online format, so thank you in advance for your patience!
